# A starter structure, scripts and packages to build a Node.js application with TypeScript and Babel in no time!

## How to get started

> - `clone the repo`
> - Inside project's root folder: `npm install`
> - To start developing: `npm run dev`
> - Then check your `localhost:4000` to see that you're **All set!**

---

> You can also use `npm run validate` to ensure that your code is good go. It will run **TypeScript** to _check your types_, **Prettier** to _check if your formatting follows the project's standard_, **ESLint** to _check if you are following all linting rules_ and finally **build** your code to _check for any errors thrown_.

> The project already uses **husky** and **lint-staged** to run the above checkings as a _pre-commit hook_, ensuring better commits.
